            <h3>Job Description</h3>
            <p>During my time at Sun Life, the DevOps team focused their efforts on building a CI/CD pipeline that was deployed using Ansible, to automate internal processes throughout the organization. The team saves invaluable time and money automating on-boarding tasks, account 
              creation & setup, certain access requests and AWS management, some of which are now 300 times quicker than when done manually.</p>
              <p>The training process included a range of tutorials on BitBucket, Docker, Hashicorp Terraform and Hashicorp Packer. After completing all the training modules assigned to me, I was tasked with creating on-boarding documentation on Terraform and Packer 
                to make it easier for professionals from other teams to join and work on the project as required. As I got more familiar with Terraform code, I worked on adding functionality to pre-existing code, such as creating filters to pick selective AWS accounts.
                I was also involved in dynamic testing with a few senior developers. 
              </p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Over the summer, Sun Life has allowed me the opportunity to acquire practical experience as a software engineer, which is invaluable
              to my future as a software engineering professional.
            </p>
            <p>Not only did I obtain new technical and personal skills, but I was also able to develop pre-existing ones too! I got the opportunity to learn from industry professionals, see how things 
              are run within a small development team, and practice what I learned from university. I learned my
              strengths, and weaknesses, and have understood what areas I need to improve on in future co-op
              terms. </p>
